# Bubble-Sort
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

## __Working__
Suppose we are trying to sort the elements in ascending order.

__1. First Iteration (Compare and Swap)__

- Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
- If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.
- Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.
- The above process goes on until the last element.
